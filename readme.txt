information for binclock.cpp utility

Creates a binary clock which is accessible from System Tray.

It uses various LED-image files for the on/off bits.

TODO:

This project has a *lot* of work that needs to be done on it.
At minimum:

> add initialization lists for the class constructors
> regif.cpp needs to be turned into standard config.cpp
> integrate common_funcs.cpp

For now, I just want to get it into the repository, because most of
the LED-image files are no longer accessible on the web.
